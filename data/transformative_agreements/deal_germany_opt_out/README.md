## About

This directory previously contained dedicated files for opt-out articles published under the German DEAL agreements. While DEAL is a transformative OA agreement, authors remain eligible to opt-out from Open Access when publishing in hybrid DEAL journals.

Up to OpenAPC version 4 (v4), opt-out articles were stored separately from the main Transformative Agreements (TA) data set.

With the release of OpenAPC version 5 (v5), these articles have been fully integrated into the TA data set. Consequently, separate opt-out files are no longer required and have been removed.

This directory is kept for documentation purposes only.
